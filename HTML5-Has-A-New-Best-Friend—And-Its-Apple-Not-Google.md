# HTML5 Has A New Best Friend—And It's Apple, Not Google

# HTML5 最好的新朋友，是 Apple 不是 Google

Google should be leading HTML5 development, [but it's not](http://readwrite.com/2014/03/10/google-html5-strategy). No, that honor goes to Apple, the company that has done more to trumpet the virtue of native apps than anyone else.

Google 本应该是 HTML5 开发的领头羊，[但并非如此](http://readwrite.com/2014/03/10/google-html5-strategy)。获此殊荣的应当是 Apple，一个比起其他任何公司做得都多，鼓吹原生应用优点的公司。

Apple isn't known for being a champion of open source or open standards, but with iOS 8 it has become both. Among a host of consumer-facing improvements to performance and the user experience, Apple has also introduced significant improvements for application developers, including WKWebView, a new browser engine that promises to make hybrid apps sing on iOS 8.

Apple 一直都不被看做开源或开放标准的带头人，但 iOS 8 为其正了名。除了大量的面向用户方面的性能和用户体验的提升，Apple 同时也显著地提升了应用开发者的开发体验，其中就包括 WKWebView，一个新的浏览器引擎，承诺让 hybrid 应用在 iOS 8上蓬勃发展！

Ironically, Apple's one-time Flash-y nemesis, Adobe, may benefit most.

讽刺的是，Adobe 可能是最大受益者，虽然 Apple 一度都反对 Flash。

# The Way We Build Now

# 目前的构建方式

Historically, performance requirements have pushed mobile developers to default to native apps, with an emphasis on either iOS or Android. HTML5 was everyone's back-up plan, as [VisionMobile illustrates](http://www.visionmobile.com/product/developer-economics-q1-2014-state-developer-nation/) in its Developer Economics quarterly report:

回望过去，无论是在 iOS 还是 Android上，性能上的要求一直在把移动开发者推向原生应用。HTML5 仅仅是大家的二手准备。从 [VisionMobile illustrates](http://www.visionmobile.com/product/developer-economics-q1-2014-state-developer-nation/) 的季度开发者生态报告就能看出来：

But something has been happening in mobile development. While native still makes the headlines, HTML5 has quietly assumed a prominent place in developers' tool chests as programmers look to reuse code across platforms and to embed Web code in their applications. The latter is "a core functionality for most apps," as Masa Tanaka, CEO and founder of a PhoneGap-development platform provider in Tokyo, [indicates](http://sdtimes.com/guest-view-hybrid-app-developers-love-new-ios-8/).

但是在移动开发领域确实在发生这一些变化。尽管原生应用还是宠儿，但当开发者需要跨平台重用代码或者在自己的应用中内嵌 Web 代码时，HTML5 就进入到他们工具箱中显眼的位置。如 Masa Tanaka [所说](http://sdtimes.com/guest-view-hybrid-app-developers-love-new-ios-8/)，在应用中内嵌 Web 代码“对于大部分应用来说都是一个核心的功能”，Masa Tanaka 来自Tokyo，是 PhoneGap 开发平台的 CEO 和创始人。

A large percentage of apps, as a separate [VisionMobile survey shows](http://www.visionmobile.com/product/developer-economics-q3-2013-state-of-the-developer-nation/), are a hybrid blend of native code and, quite often, HTML5:

如 [VisionMobile 另一个调研所示](http://www.visionmobile.com/product/developer-economics-q3-2013-state-of-the-developer-nation/)，有很大一部分应用通常是原生代码和 HTML5 的合体：

While HTML5 has managed to eke out a quiet coexistence with native code, Apple just gave it a first-class ticket with the introduction of iOS 8.

尽管 HTML5 已经设法制造出了一个与原生代码并存的空间，但随着 iOS 8 的发布，Apple 给 HTML5 了一张头等舱的票。

# Apple Makes HTML5 Sing

# Apple 让 HTML5 歌唱

A number of people have looked into iOS 8's improved support for HTML5, but none has offered as detailed a look at both features and performance as Sencha's Ross Gerbasi. Among many other improvements, Gerbasi showcases a few of the most important ones:

WKWebView, a replacement for UIWebView, includes the Nitro JS engine, which Gerbasi notes has been "tested and measured to have at least 4x the performance of UIWebView." Not surprisingly, "This has the potential to be a huge win for hybrid apps."

Nor is it really surprising that "native first" Apple would work so hard to improve the HTML5 experience. As noted above, developers want to embed the Web into their apps, and Apple wants developers to have a fantastic iOS experience. As such, anything that makes its devices better, Apple will support.

# Adobe Embraces Jobs' Vision

# Adobe 拥抱 Jobs 的洞察力

Especially if it's bad for Flash. By supporting HTML5, Apple gets to follow up on the late Steve Jobs' desire to bury Flash and have it replaced by HTML5. In his "Thoughts on Flash," Jobs pilloried proprietary Flash even as he touted the openness of HTML5. He concludes:

> New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind.

Of course, Adobe did, in fact, embrace HTML5, and in a big way. In late 2011 Adobe acquired Nitobi, developer of the popular PhoneGap, a highly popular platform for building HTML5 and JavaScript applications. Since that time Adobe has continued to invest in PhoneGap.

Arguably, however, Apple just did more to advance PhoneGap than Adobe could. As good as iOS 8 is for HTML5, generally, it's particularly good for PhoneGap, as software development house Scirra details:

While this chart clearly shows PhoneGap performance improvements on iOS 8, it doesn't show just how good they will be when PhoneGap adopts WKWebView in its next release. (Adobe has been trying to, as it writes, but a bug currently prevents it from using WKWebView.) Once WKWebView is incorporated, according to Scirra, PhoneGap will "close this [performance] gap and match Safari's performance."

All of which is great for Apple, because it means developers will have even more ways to build great apps for iOS 8. But it's also great for Apple's one-time nemesis, Adobe, as its PhoneGap platform disproportionately benefits.
