# The 5 Most Popular Frontend Frameworks of 2014 Compared

Nowadays there is a deluge of CSS front-end frameworks. But the number of really good ones can be narrowed down to just a few.

现如今快要被各种各样的 CSS 前端框架给淹没了，真做的不错的其实也就那么几个。

In this article we’ll compare what I think are the five best frameworks available today. Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and specific areas of application, allowing you to choose based on the needs of a specific project. For example, if your project is simple, there is no need to use a complex framework. Also, many of the options are modular, allowing you to use only the components you need, or even mix components from different frameworks.

本文将对比五个我认为是现在最好的框架。这些框架每一个都有自己的优缺点和适用的应用类型， 你需要根据自己的需要来选择不同的框架。例如，如果你的项目简单，就不需要使用一个复杂的框架。又或者，很多可选项都是模块化的，你可以只是用你需要的模块，或者把不同框架的模块混到一起使用。

The frameworks that I’m going to explore are presented based on their GitHub popularity, beginning with the most popular, which is, of course, Bootstrap.

我将要介绍的这些框架的顺序与它们在 GitHub 的流行程度有关。自然，就是从最流行的 Bootstrap 说起。

Also note that the framework sizes are the minified sizes of the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

### Notes on Bootstrap

### Bootstrap 使用心得

The main strength of Bootstrap is its huge popularity. Technically, it’s not necessarily better than the others in the list, but it offers many more resources (articles and tutorials, third-party plug-ins and extensions, theme builders, and so on) than the other four frameworks combined. In short, Bootstrap is everywhere. And this is the main reason people continue to choose it.

(Note: By saying “unique components” I mean that they are unique compared only to the frameworks mentioned in this list.)

## What’s the Right Framework for You?

## 如何选择框架？

In the end, let me give you some guidelines for choosing the right framework. Here are some of the more important things to watch out for:

- Does the framework have enough popularity? Bigger popularity means more people involved in the project, and thus, more tutorials and articles from the community, more real-world examples/websites, more third-party extensions, and better integration with relative web development products. Great popularity also means that the framework is more future-proof – a framework with a bigger community around it is much less likely to be abandoned.
- Is the framework under active development? A good framework needs to level up constantly with the latest web technologies, especially with regards to mobile.
- Has the framework reached maturity? If a particular framework is not yet used and tested in real-world projects, then you can freely play with it, but to rely on it for your professional projects would likely be unwise.
- Does the framework offer good documentation? Good documentation is always desirable in order to facilitate the learning process.
- What is the framework’s level of specificity? The main point here is that a more generic framework is far easier to work with, in comparison to a framework with high-level specificity. In most cases it’s better to choose a framework with minimal styles applied because it’s much easier to customize. Adding new CSS rules is a far more convenient and efficient process compared to overwriting or overriding existing ones. Plus, if you add new rules on top of the existing ones, you’ll end up with unused rules, which will increase unnecessarily the size of the CSS.

Finally, in case you’re still unsure, you can adopt a mix-and-match approach. If a particular framework doesn’t satisfy your needs, you can mix components from two or more projects. For example, you can get smaller CSS base styling from one framework, a preferred grid system from another, and more complex components from a third. Viva modularity! :)

What are your thoughts? Do any of these frameworks have any strengths and weaknesses that weren’t mentioned here? Do you think there are others that should have been listed? Let us know in the discussion below.
